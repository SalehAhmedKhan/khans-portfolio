      "High on the mountain’s upper slopes, where smoke thickens and sound thins, some climbers swear they are not alone. In the haze and glare, a shape sometimes stirs—two burning points watching from the ash. No one can say for certain whether it is a creature standing still, or lava, for a moment, learning how to look back. Ashpaw walks where stone melts and night tightens, his eyes lit with the earth’s oldest heat.",
      "Only those who dare to climb the mountain speak his name at all. Some believe he guards the heights; others say he is the mountain’s patience. When the ash falls quiet and the ground holds its breath, he is said to be listening. Fire does not rise without cause, nor does Ashpaw wake without reason. What he protects is not named—only endured."
