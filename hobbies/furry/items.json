    "shortDescription": [
      "High on the mountain’s upper slopes, where smoke thickens and sound thins, some climbers swear they are not alone. In the haze and glare, a shape sometimes stirs—two burning points watching from the ash. No one can say for certain whether it is a creature standing still, or lava, for a moment, learning how to look back. Ashpaw walks where stone melts and night tightens, his eyes lit with the earth’s oldest heat.",
      "Only those who dare to climb the mountain speak his name at all. Some believe he guards the heights; others say he is the mountain’s patience. When the ash falls quiet and the ground holds its breath, he is said to be listening. Fire does not rise without cause, nor does Ashpaw wake without reason. What he protects is not named—only endured."

    "shortDescription": [
      "The Snoroo is one of the most iconic predators of the shifting tundra — vast, open reaches of wind-carved white where the ground is never truly still. These frozen expanses seem barren at first glance, stretched flat beneath a pale sky, but the silence hides a landscape in motion, alive with subtle dangers that most travellers only understand when it is already too late.",
      "Beneath the surface lies soft, drifting powder over deep hollows and hidden sink-snow, constantly reshaped by blizzards sweeping across the plain. The ground appears gentle and harmless — smooth, even inviting — yet a single wrong step can send a person sinking soundlessly downward. Many have vanished here, trapped chest-deep as the snow collapses around them, smothering breath and muffling cries beneath the endless open white.",
      "The Snoroo, however, was born for this world. With powerful hind limbs and fur-padded feet, it can glide across unstable drifts with effortless bounds, barely disturbing the surface. Despite its plush coat and calm watchfulness, the Snoroo is no herbivore: it is a carnivorous hunter, sensing faint movements beneath the powder and plunging suddenly through the snow to seize whatever stirs below. Even the young learn quickly at their parent’s side — and to those who dwell along the cold frontiers, the Snoroo remains a living warning that the snow is never empty, and the plains are never safe."
