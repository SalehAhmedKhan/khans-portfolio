      "A hard-surface modeling study focused on layered mechanical components and worn industrial materials.",
      "The piece explores balance between symmetry and imperfection, using subtle bevels and edge wear to avoid a sterile look.",
      "Lighting was kept minimal to emphasize form, silhouette, and material response rather than surface detail."
