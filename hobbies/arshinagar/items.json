      "From narrow dinghis and fishing boats to wide river ferries and cargo crafts, Bengal’s boats were built for tide, trade, and travel. Each design evolved from the rhythm of oars, monsoon waters, and everyday survival.",
      "Slender dinghis skimmed shallow canals, while sturdy koshas and panshis carried nets, grain, and people across open rivers. Large bajras and merchant boats moved slowly with the current, their high hulls shaped for long journeys and heavy loads. Together, these vessels formed a living river economy—quiet, resilient, and deeply woven into daily life.",
